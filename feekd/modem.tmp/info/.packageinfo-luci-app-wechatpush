        help
                The traffic statistics feature relies on the wrtbwmon package. This plugin may conflict with Routing/NAT, Flow Offloading, and proxy internet access plugins, potentially leading to an inability to retrieve traffic information.

        bool "Local Disk Information Detection"
        help
                If the lsblk package is not installed, the total disk capacity information might be inconsistent with actual values. When smartctl is not installed, information about disk temperature, power-on time, health status, and more will be unavailable. If you are using a virtual machine or have not installed a physical disk, this feature is typically unnecessary.

        help
                When using a virtual machine and requiring information about the host machine's temperature and disk details, you need to install openssh-client and openssh-keygen for SSH connections.
