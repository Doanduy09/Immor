Description:   An open source Spotify client running as a UNIX daemon.

  Spotifyd streams music just like the official client, but is more
  lightweight and supports more platforms. Spotifyd also supports the
  Spotify Connect protocol, which makes it show up as a device that
  can be controlled from the official clients.
