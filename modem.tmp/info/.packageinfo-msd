Description:  Multi Stream daemon (msd) - is a program for organizing streaming IPTV on the network via HTTP.
 One server can serve thousands of clients simultaneously.
 The focus is on maximum performance, as well as a variety of subtle adjustments related to the perceptual quality of customer service: speed channel switching, fault tolerance transfer.
